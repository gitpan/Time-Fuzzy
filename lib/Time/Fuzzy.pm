=head1 NAME

Time::Fuzzy - Time read like a human, with some fuzziness



=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Time::Fuzzy;

    my $now = fuzzy();
    $Time::Fuzzy::FUZZINESS = 'low'; # or 'high', 'medium' (default)
    my $fuz = fuzzy( DateTime->new(...) );

    my $fuzzy = Time::Fuzzy->new;
    print $fuzzy->as_str;



=head1 DESCRIPTION

Nobody will ever say "it's 11:57". People just say "it's noon".

This Perl module does just the same: it adds some human fuzziness to the
way computer deal with time.

By default, C<Time::Fuzzy> is using a medium fuzziness factor. You can
change that by modifying C<$Time::Fuzzy::FUZZINESS>. The accepted values
are C<low>, C<medium> or C<high>.




=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 my $fuzzy = fuzzy( [ $dt ] )

Return the fuzzy time defined by C<$dt>, a C<DateTime> object. If no
argument, return the (fuzzy) current time.



=head1 METHODS

If you prefer, you can use C<Time::Fuzzy> in a OOP style. In that case,
the following methods are available.



=head2 my $fuzzy = Item::Fuzzy->new( [dt=>$dt, fuzziness=>fuzziness] )

This is the constructor. It accepts the following params:


=over 4

=item . dt => $dt: a C<DateTime> object, defaults to current time.

=item . fuzziness => $fuzziness: the wanted fuziness, defaults to
current C<$Time::Fuzzy::FUZZINESS>.

=back


Additionally, the accessors C<dt> and C<fuzziness> are available.


=head2 my $str = $fuzzy->as_str()

Return the fuzzy string of the current time of the object. This method
is also the overloaded stringified method.



=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature requests to C<< < bug-time-fuzzy at
rt.cpan.org> >>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Time-Fuzzy>.  I will be
notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on your
bug as I make changes.
